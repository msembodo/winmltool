# winmltool
A Simple WITSML Client

WITSML is widely used nowadays for exchanging well drilling data between parties. As one of service companies who delivers WITSML service, we sometime have no idea if our customers are receiving the data in correct fashion; other than asking them how the data looks at their end. This is the reason behind the writing of this simple utility.

What it actually does is printing lists of available wells and wellbores, and log objects associated to them. Usage is very simple. But please be mind that it only works for API wells; you will get weird values when connecting to metric database.
